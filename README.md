This is the repository for the code in the paper *Incorporating Features Learned by an Enhanced Deep Knowledge Tracing Model for STEM/Non-STEM Job Prediction*.

The `.py` files are mainly about the implementation of the DKT/DKT+ model. The DKT+ implementation is adopted in this [github](https://github.com/ckyeungac/deep-knowledge-tracing-plus).

The experiment results obtained in the sections 4.3 and 5.1 are based on the `main_experiment.ipynb`. The DKT and the DKT+ knowledge state comparison in the discussion are based on `KnowledgeTrend.ipynb` and `KnowledgeStateDimensionReduction.ipynb`.
